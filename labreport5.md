 ### Revisiting Lab Report 2
 In lab report 3 I learned all the different mechanisms of the `find` command
 in bash. I used online tools like google engine and chatgpt to learn about
 the different mechanisms of the `find` command. 
 I discovered you can use `-type f` or `-type d` to find anything that is
 a file or directory in the current working directory.
 I also learned that you can use `-name "<name>"` to find any file or
 directory that contains <name>.
  
 Later I learned that you can put two commands together so I was able to write
 the find commands on one line to further specify what I wanted to find.
 So if I wanted to find a directory with a specific charcter or name in it
 you can put `find -type d -name "<name>"` as the command. 
 
  For example if I wanted to find a directory with the keyword "non" in it:

  Which is a better alternative to just searching through all the directories:
